# Battleship-AI

This program simulates a game of Battleship!

In this game of Battleship, the user competes against the program and the program is specially engineered to play like a human would. As an example of the logic that the program follows, if the program happens to get a hit on a battle ship, it's next move would be to check the square around that hit. Once the program gets another hit on one of the squares surrounding the intitial hit, it will continue to make moves in that direction until the targeted battleship is sunk. Although there much more complexity in a situation like this depending on where the targeted ship is located and where the first strike was made, this outlines a simple example of how the program would perform.
