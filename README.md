# Battleship-AI

This program simulates a game of Battleship!

In this game of Battleship, the user competes against the program and the program is specially engineered to play like a human would. 
For example, if the program happens to get a hit on a battle ship, it's next move would be to check the squares around that hit. Once the program gets
another hit on one of the squares surrounding the intitial hit, it will continue to make moves in that direction until the targeted battleship is sunk.
